  <p>I had a dream about how different we were. That I could never be accepted.<br>
<br>

Tall men waltzed, wearing slim suits and jackets in the center of a hazy ballroom.<br>
I, off to the side, watched at shoulder-level.<br>
<br>
<br>
A man my age came up to me. He shoved me, I fell or maybe I just took a step back.<br>
I looked to him, confused. Was this animosity? Was I to shove him back? Were we to laugh then embrace? I did nothing. Just looked up at him. I should’ve known what to do.<br>
<br>
—<br>
<br>
Tall men brushed past me. Knocking me off my step. Looking down. Nearly looking through. Not scowling, not to be inconvenienced, just carrying on with their nights as I watched at shoulder-level.<br>
<br>
The floor was cleared. Off to the side, I sat on the ground or maybe kneeled or squatted. At the center of it all, you were dancing. We watched. We were captivated. I was double captivated. You, the star, <br>gleaming, did a dance that I didn’t know the steps to. A dance that I had never been taught.<br>
<br>
I didn’t think that you could see me.<br>
<br>
—<br>
<br>
Tall men marched in cadence, crosshatching. One, after the other, weaving in-front and behind each other. Working their way through the pattern to the front of the room, where I assumed you were, then <br>marching, crosshatching their way back to me. I waited for a break in the pattern but one never came. They just cleanly, perfectly, with class and finesse passed each other, one after the other, after the <br>other. Leaving no space for me to pass or see through.<br>

“I looked for you but I couldn’t find you. I didn’t know if I would ever be able to. I had a dream about how different we were. That I could never be accepted,” the boy said.<br>
<br>
She stared then looked away.<br>
