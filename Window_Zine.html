  <p>A SERIES OF QUESTIONS FOR A LOVED ONE<br><br>If you were a window, where would you be? At what latitude would you like your sun to rise?<br> Would you like to be crystal clear or smudged, pressed against, drawn on.<br> Would you stay in one place or move? Move quickly?<br> If you were a window, would you like to be surrounded by stone, wood, metal, vines, and/or air?
<br><br> &nbsp; 

If you were a window to the world, would you be square or round?<br>What type of windows would surround you? How many? <br> Could the people on the street see through to the inside? <br> Would you be high and out of reach or close to earth, home? Underground? <br> Could you be climbed through? 
<br><br> &nbsp;

If the boys played baseball in the park nearby would you feel safe? Could you break? And if broken would you be able to be find your pieces and put them back together? 
<br><br> &nbsp;

How reflective are you? And how are you dealing with your many panes? If there was suffering outside could you open up? And if you opened would it be to invite us over or for shouts to be sent out? And if the people on the inside fought, would you let light in?
<br><br> &nbsp;

And why have we let Tik Tok run our social lives? 3 AM on a December night is a terrible time leave. And you have no windows in your place anyways so why care what they think? 
<br><br> &nbsp;
Am I old fashioned? Am I over thinking all this? Could it be simple? Are you just a window who’d like to be railed?</p>

A MIRROR, A WINDOW, A POOL<br><br>
For Amelita Galli-Curci<br><br>
All very old; all partially transfigured,
But still reflective, magnetised to life.
Through them great beauty swam or looked or beckoned,
Or was endangered or supremely safe.
Or trembled on the brink of summer folly,
Or read the truth in hieroglyphs of flesh.
Or saw the kiss it could not feel or savor,
Saw thunder or could hear the lightning flash.
How distant from the mines are diamonds carried!
How far from light the mirror hangs to die!
How long from shore the lilies must be ferried
That call the self of memory to say:
Whose limbs were lengthened through this lovely water?
Whose breath lay, living, on this fragile pane?
Whose eyes no longer beg this shallow silver
For years beyond this room, like mine, like mine?
