  The bird flying up at the windowpane
  aspired to the blue sky reflected in it
  but learned the hard truth and flew off again.
  Was it a finch, a blue tit or a linnet?
  I couldn’t quite identify the strain.

  Checking a pocket guide to get it right—
  “The Birds of Ireland,” illustrated text—
  I note the precise graphic work and definite
  descriptions there, and yet I’m still perplexed.
  I only glimpsed the bird in busy flight:

  bit like a goldfinch, like the captive one
  perched on a rail, by Rembrandt’s young disciple,
  except for the coloring, blue, yellow, and green.
  A tit so, one of those from the bird table
  which whirr at hanging nuts and grain.

  Off he flew. Now there’s a mist out there
  and a mist in here that wouldn’t interest him,
  since what he wants is sky and open air.
  He’s in the leaves; I’m trying one more time
  to find an opening in the stratosphere.
