<br>
 &nbsp;All very old; all partially transfigured,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; But still reflective, magnetised to life.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through them great beauty swam or looked or beckoned,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or was endangered or supremely safe.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or trembled on the brink of summer folly,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or read the truth in hieroglyphs of flesh.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or saw the kiss it could not feel or savor,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saw thunder or could hear the lightning flash.<br><br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How distant from the mines are diamonds carried!<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How far from light the mirror hangs to die!<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How long from shore the lilies must be ferried<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That call the self of memory to say:<br><br>
Whose limbs were lengthened through this lovely water?<br>
Whose breath lay, living, on this fragile pane?<br>
Whose eyes no longer beg this shallow silver<br>
For years beyond this room, like mine, like mine?<br>
