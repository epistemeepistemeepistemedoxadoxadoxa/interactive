   GREAT HILL NY,NY<br><br>
   We spent a few days in the rain dancing. Dreamt of green hills growing out from ground which was cold and hard at the moment. A few nights drinking, warm embraces. A sweet, smoke smell coming in breaths, sighs, laughs, when you spoke. Something familiar, settled, soothing. I fear that we’d not be able to speak to each other sober. I fear that if we did the death would come by a thousand questions. That you could not know me. You did not know me. Inevitable, the destruction, even if you did. You asked a few questions, they never got to the heart of anything. Who were you supposed to be? Who was I? You definitely weren’t anything like me.  And this place, these people, they were not my own. Not for me. I wanted to say to you; Imagine a barren place, a tundra’s tanned earth, snow falling slowly from grey skies. Mountains in the distance. Cold air passes over your ears and meets your face in infinity. In that moment, alone with your eyes closed, looking through it all, who are you? What do you think you look like? With no direction and nothing human in sight, Where is home? What is hope? What is home? Where to start? Could home be a ray of light venturing through the mundane, touching your face, saying hello for the first time. Sun slipping through curtains and closed doors to warmly embrace us right where we stand? Where to start? If you were a window, where would you be? At what latitude would you like your sun to rise? Would you like to be crystal clear or smudged, pressed against, drawn on? Would you stay in one place or move? And move quickly? If you were a window, would you like to be surrounded by stone, wood, metal, vines, and/or air? If you were a window to the world, would you be square or round? What type of windows would surround you? How many? Could the people on the street see through to the inside? Would you be high and out of reach, outer space, or down to earth, close to home? Could you be climbed through? Are you underground? Can I see you? How reflective are you? And how are you dealing with your many panes? If the boys played baseball in the park nearby would you feel safe? Could you break? And if broken would you be able to be find your pieces and put them back together? If there was suffering outside could you open up? And if you opened would it be to invite us over or would shouts be sent out? If the cathedral burned would you let us out? And if the people on the inside fought, would you let light in? And why have we let Tik Tok run our social lives? 3 AM on a December night is a terrible time leave. And you have no windows in your place anyways so why care what they think? Why do we torture each other? Why do we do this to ourselves? Where to start? Am I old fashioned? Am I over thinking all of this? Could it be simple? Are you just a window who'd like to be railed? Where to start? A few nights drinking, in a strange land. Les cheveux roses. Warm embraces. A bed of hands, of breaths, of drinks. An escape from a cold place which maybe I should be confronting, driving face first into. You? You make me afraid. You disappoint me. I can’t help you, I try but I can barely help myself. And I’m afraid I’d lose the both of us in keeping up with you. In trying to be better than I’m supposed to. And what if some how I kept up and then you were gone by spring? Then, once again, I’d spend a few days in the rain dancing. I’d have dreams of green hills growing out of ground which was cold and hard at the moment. Could it ever thaw?  My nights would be slow, quiet. And maybe hope could be birthed by a thousand questions. Change could bring a warm embrace. And I’d walk, I’ll walk — alone in the cold with my thoughts knowing things could change. And soon the french boys will play soccer, the boys in the park nearby, baseball.

A MIRROR, A WINDOW, A POOL<br><br>
For Amelita Galli-Curci
All very old; all partially transfigured,
But still reflective, magnetised to life.
Through them great beauty swam or looked or beckoned,
Or was endangered or supremely safe.
Or trembled on the brink of summer folly,
Or read the truth in hieroglyphs of flesh.
Or saw the kiss it could not feel or savor,
Saw thunder or could hear the lightning flash.
How distant from the mines are diamonds carried!
How far from light the mirror hangs to die!
How long from shore the lilies must be ferried
That call the self of memory to say:
Whose limbs were lengthened through this lovely water?
Whose breath lay, living, on this fragile pane?
Whose eyes no longer beg this shallow silver
For years beyond this room, like mine, like mine?

A WINDOW ON THE WORLD (Def.) <br><br>
window on the world<br>
A means of experiencing or learning about parts of the world beyond one's immediate surroundings or situation.<br>
Kids are spoiled rotten with the amount they can learn and see on the internet. In my day, the only window on the world was whatever books the local library had.<br>
